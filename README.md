# Customer-segmentation
In this R Project, we will implement customer segmentation in R. Whenever you need to find your best customer, customer segmentation is the ideal methodology. In this machine learning project, we will provide you the background of customer segmentation. Then we will explore the data upon which we will be building our segmentation model. Also, in this project, we will see the descriptive analysis of our data and then implement several versions of the K-means algorithm. So, follow the complete data science customer segmentation project using machine learning in R
